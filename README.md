## ABSTRACT
MITRE ATT&CK is a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) are behaviors, methods, or patterns of activity used by threat actors or groups of threat actors. This paper introduces a novel scoring system using Adversarial Impact Metrics (AIM) to prioritize MITRE ATT&CK techniques and tactics to improve threat detection, prioritization, and cybersecurity defense in general. The approach incorporates several scoring parameters, including prevalence, exploitability, attack vector, and complexity, to provide a clear and orderly framework for analyzing and ranking cyber threats. This research addresses a major problem that is inherent in most threat intelligence platforms: the absence of a base scoring system, which makes it impossible to prioritize TTPs after an alert has been generated. The methodology is scalable and relevant to any organization, as it integrates a standardized and adaptable scoring system, enabling organizations to respond dynamically to risks based on their potential impact and the ease of exploitation. By facilitating a deeper understanding of resource allocation for cybersecurity teams, organizations enhance their capacity to respond to emerging threats, thereby strengthening their cybersecurity resilience amidst escalating risks.

## RESEARCH GOALS
Throughout this research, we want to present a scalable scoring system for prioritizing cyber threats in the MITRE ATT&CK framework by mapping TTPs to CVSS metrics and Adversarial Impact Metrics (AIM) using our preprocessed datasets. These metrics are identified as being subjective and adaptable to an organization’s contextual setting, and manually calculated in the final scores to guarantee precision, consistency and alignment to the defined methodology. This approach allows organizations to systematically examine and rank threat tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) against risk. The analysis focuses on six advanced persistent threat (APT) groups—Akira, Lazarus Group, Play, Sidewinder, and Wizard Spider—covering 247 techniques across critical sectors such as finance and healthcare. The dynamic scoring framework developed in this research is expected to enable organizations to prioritize cyber threats based on their severity and relevance using an objective, standardized approach. The base scoring system provides a foundation that can be adapted to meet the needs of different organizations, thereby facilitating more effective threat detection and response strategies.
